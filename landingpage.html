Commission is earned through August 14th.  Therefore, commission will be included in the September 1st payout.<p>

		<h1>How does the affiliate program work?<h1>
		<p>Affiliates can earn commission two ways:<p>	
		<p>1. By referring people with upcoming events to our site to submit a quote request. When a user submits a request for an event and indicates needing various categories of services (a florist, DJ and caterer, for example), that request produces vendor leads for all requested categories.  Up to 5 vendors per category can purchase the lead to connect directly with the requesting user.  So if a user needs 7 services, up to 35 total vendors could buy Leads from that single request.  Lead prices range from $4.95 for most categories/counties to $12.95 in highly populated areas. Affiliates earn commission on leads purchased for 30 days following the submission of a quotÂ¬e request, at which time the commission is approved and payable.  Leads purchased with complimentary credits are not commissionable.<p>	
		<p>2. By referring event vendors to our site to create or claim business profiles. Vendors can create free profiles but they may also opt to purchase paid profiles, display ads and/or credits for Leads.  Affiliates earn commisison on first time orders of those items if purchased within 30 days of using the affiliate link.<p>			
		<p>All affiliate links can be used one time by any given user.<p>
